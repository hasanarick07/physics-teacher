        At first, allow me to tell you how a typical school teacher teaches
        physics:
        <li>
          Gives theories and formulas to students to memorize without proper
          understanding.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tell students memorizing theories and formulas is the only way to
          solve problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          Telling students that nobody likes physics or the subject is hard by
          nature, but they HAVE to learn.
        </li>
        <li>
          Discouraging or not allowing students to solve problems in their way
          or method.
        </li>
        <li>
          Giving students fixed questions and telling the tests or exams will
          have these questions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeating questions in exams or tests that students already solved in
          the classroom.
        </li>
        <li>Asking questions with a straight answer.</li>
        <li>
          Concentrating overly on computation and solutions rather than the
          methods.
        </li>
        <li>Giving students only a few seconds to come up with an answer.</li>

      <h4>
        Most students study physics the same way they study chemistry or
        biology, which is wrong. But unlike those subjects, physics has complex
        topics and formulas, which is why they get frustrated quickly. This is
        especially true when their grades are low and find no noticeable
        improvements despite studying hard.
      </h4>
      <h4>
        The point here is that students should realize that physics is a
        conceptual subject, unlike other subjects. Physics deals with the
        abstract and immaterial side of the “matter” such as weight, speed,
        gravity, acceleration, and other concepts. These concepts should be
        taught and learned using a different method. Memorizing will do little
        here, but logical thinking will do all the work.
